CLI-PARTY
=========

([enbiggen][])

A cli-party is a collaborative event utilizing [Cloud9][1]'s [Ubuntu Docker][2] instances running what appears to be a js layer on top of tmux. This provides an excellent learning opportunity to essentially play with the REPL that the shell is.

RULES
-----
 * PLAY NICE! if you break it, you put it back the way it was. ☺
 * no `nano` allowed! `vim`'s escape key is set to `jk`.
 * don't forget to clean up your mess. we only got 5G.

NOTES
-----
 * the default location is `$HOME/workspace` = `linuxpadawan/wxl-cli-party.git` ≠ `$HOME`.
 * no `nano` allowed! `vim`'s escape key is set to `jk`.
 * creating new panes in `tmux` doesn't end well. stick to windows.
 * `asciiportal` is in `~/playground` but it's visually messed up. you're welcome to fix it. might check out `/usr/bin/games`.
 * you should join the [party][3].

REPO
----
Currently, it only contains some dotfiles that are symlinked to this repo. You can push stuff to it if you want.
