CLI-PARTY
=========

A cli-party is a collaborative event utilizing [Cloud9][1]'s [Ubuntu Docker][2] instances running what appears to be a js layer on top of tmux. This provides an excellent learning opportunity to essentially play with the REPL that the shell is.

If you're reading this in c9 terminal
-------------------------------------
 * the default location is `$HOME/workspace` = `linuxpadawan/wxl-cli-party.git`.
 * you are technically the `ubuntu` user, regardless of what the prompt suggests.
 * no `nano` allowed! `vim`'s escape key is set to `jk`.
 * creating new panes in `tmux` doesn't end well. stick to windows.
 * `asciiportal` is in `~/playground` but it's visually messed up. TODO: fix it!
 * don't forget to clean up your mess. we only got 5G.

If you're looking at the repo
-----------------------------
 * nothing too exciting here, except some dotfiles. 
 * you should join the [party][3].
